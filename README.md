# Bootpack
##### Bootstrap for Webpack, Express & Angular

This seed will give you an Angular & Webpack setup with a full fledged Express server.

If all you need is a simple dev server, you're probably better off using Webpack on it's own. But, if you want to run Webpack along side a full node server, this is a good way to start.


#### Out of the box
You get Express, Angular (2), Pug, Sass, Socket.io & Redis sessions.

However, you can easily re-configure to use React, Handlebars, Stylus, and most any other frameworks & libraries.
